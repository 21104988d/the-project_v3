Payou is a secure, high-performance mobile application for iOS and Android that enables instant, "gasless" crypto payments on an Ethereum Layer 2 network. It is designed to feel as fast and intuitive as leading traditional payment apps while providing the core benefits of blockchain technology.

## Key Innovations

*   **Gasless Experience:** Users transact in USDC without needing ETH for gas fees. Our community-funded Vault handles network fees in the background.
*   **Non-Custodial & Secure:** Users have full control over their funds. Private keys are stored securely in the device's hardware enclave.
*   **Dynamic & Transparent Fees:** A simple, predictable fee structure powers the platform sustainably.
*   **Community-Powered Vault:** Users can deposit ETH into our Vault to provide liquidity and earn rewards in ETH.
