## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure the bug hasn't already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/21104988d/the-project_v3/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/21104988d/the-project_v3/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style. We use standard Dart and Flutter linting rules.
